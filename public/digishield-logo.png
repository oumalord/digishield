Since the existing code is empty and the task is to create a logo, which is a visual element and not code, I cannot represent the logo as code. The `public/digishield-logo.png` file would contain the image data itself, not code. The description in the updates outlines the visual characteristics of the logo. Therefore, there is no code to generate or merge.
